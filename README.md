### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

You've done it. Somehow you managed to find my GitHub repo.

I'm a back-end developer turned Scrum Master, turned Agile Coach, turned Delivery Manager...

I love software. And in here you will find some pieces of code I write on my free time for fun.

The code snippets here are messy, half-formed and unpolished.

But they might actually be useful to other people.

Browse around. And let me know if I can help.
